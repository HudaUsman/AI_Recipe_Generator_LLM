Enhanced my existing AI-Powered Recipe Generator Web App by integrating an AI Assistant feature using OpenAI/Gemini APIs. Added a dedicated AI Assistant section on the homepage, allowing users to ask natural language queries for recipe suggestions, ingredient alternatives, cooking methods, and dietary advice.

The application already supported features like:

Random recipe generation

Recipe search by ingredients

Recipe search by dish name

With this upgrade, the project now offers a blend of traditional backend API handling and modern LLM-powered conversational interactions, delivering a smarter, AI-enhanced culinary experience to users.
